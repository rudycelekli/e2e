`decisionExecutor({ providerOptions })` sends provider options with every decide call, the completion checks included, such as `{ gateway: { zeroDataRetention: true } }` for Vercel AI Gateway. They reach the decision model only: the text model keeps the agents entry's `providerOptions`. A value that does not map provider names to option objects fails config load with `INVALID_CONFIG`.
